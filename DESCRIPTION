Description: An approach to identify microbiome biomarker for time to event data by discovering microbiome for predicting survival 
    and classifying subjects into risk groups. Classifiers are constructed as a linear combination of important microbiome and treatment 
    effects if necessary. Several methods were implemented to estimate the microbiome risk score such as majority voting technique, LASSO, 
    Elastic net, supervised principle component analysis (SPCA), and supervised partial least squares analysis (SPLS).
    Sensitivity analysis on the quantile used for the classification can also be accessed to check the deviation of the classification group 
    based on the quantile specified. Large scale cross validation can be performed in order to investigate the mostly selected microbiome and 
    for internal validation. During the evaluation process, validation is accessed using the hazard ratios (HR) distribution of the test set 
    and inference is mainly based on resampling and permutations technique.
